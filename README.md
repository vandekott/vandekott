### 👨‍💻 I'm Dias Doreen

I'm glad you visited my profile. May I tell you a little about myself? Thank you,🤨
Now I am in the 🌃 of **Pavlodar** (🇰🇿 Kazakhstan), working with the _[Soko.Space](https://soko.space/) company_ on a remote basis 😕🔫.

I position myself as a *junior backend developer* in *PHP*, and I *improve* in this every day.

My main tool is Laravel Framework, in my projects 
I use TALL-stack which includes 
* Tailwind CSS - Modern CSS framework with a utilitarian approach to layout, 
* Alpine JS - Vue-like simple javascript framework, 
* Laravel - framework for web artisans, 
* Livewire - Livewire is a framework that makes building dynamic interfaces simple.

My hardware now: 💻 Acer Swift 1 Laptop on 🐧 Fedora with Gnome Desktop

I'm currently looking for:
* 🤸‍♂️ switch to office work
* 📈 improve my skills and increase my income
* ...beeing as cool as it possible
